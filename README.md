# ShipperStatusPlus
ShipperStatuesPlus is an application developed in Python for SDEV 140 Introduction to Software Development at Ivy Tech Community College. This program serves to solve the problem of large organizations losing track of packages which they order due to others misplacing them. 

The program lets users enter their package's shipping ID which will them be in the system, that other employees can see. Once another employee sees the package arrive at the business they can then check the program to see who they need to deliver it to. If they don't need to deliver it then they can put it in a specific place in their in-person inventory management system which can be found later.
